# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to provide an understanding of ride-sharing market data, specifically weekly fares by city type across Jan-Apr 2019. 

## Results

In the above analysis, we see that urbanization correlates with a increase in total fares, with the lowest average fares per ride & driver. There are likely two factors for this:
  1. The number of total rides & total drivers in relation to total fares is significantly higher for urban cities than for suburban & rural cities. This is partly due to the fact that total drivers exceeds total rides, indicating a significant amount of inactive drivers.
  2. The fare distance is likely shorter in urban cities when compared to suburban & rural cities.

Here we see total fares measured in USD, peaking around late February - early March and bottoming in early January. Presumably, less people are interested in ride-sharing services when the weather is colder.

## Summary

In summary, I'd like to make the following recommendations to the ride-sharing business:

  1. Our analysis shows that urban cities currently have more drivers than they do rides. This means there are at least 780 inactive drivers. Either eliminate these people from your workforce, or create more demand for their services.
  2. Demand for ride-sharing services in rural areas could be suppressed due to the high average fare for each ride. Consider hiring more drivers in these locations to make fares more accessible to customers.
  3. Demand appears to be seasonal - focus on creating additional demand for ride-sharing services in warmer months.
